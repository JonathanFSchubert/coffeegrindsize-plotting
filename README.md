# coffeegrindsize-plotting
I wanted a program that mimics the plotting style as used in the book The Physics of Filter Coffee by Jonathan Gagné.

This Program tries to mimic the plotting from the Book Physics of Filter Coffee by Jonathan Gagné.

It uses the .csv files that are generated by the Grind Size Application.


Usage:

python -m venv venv-plot

source venv-plot/bin/activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python plotting.py file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv ...
