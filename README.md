# coffeegrindsize-plotting
I wanted a program that mimics the plotting style as used in the book The Physics of Filter Coffee by Jonathan Gagn√©.

It uses the .csv files that are generated by the Grind Size Application.

You can merge multiple CSV files with mergeCSV.py

Usage:

python -m venv venv-plot

source venv-plot/bin/activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python plotting.py file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv ...
