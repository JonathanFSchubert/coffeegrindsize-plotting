# coffeegrindsize-plotting
I wanted a program that mimics the plotting style as used in the book The Physics of Filter Coffee by Jonathan Gagn√©.

It uses the .csv files that are generated by the Grind Size Application.


Usage:

python -m venv venv-plot

source venv-plot/bin/activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python plotting.py file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv ...

todo:
using permutations f only 80% of the data to make the blurred images of the lines to see how good the data is (see the Book)
also i currently dont really undetstand how he plotted the D10
